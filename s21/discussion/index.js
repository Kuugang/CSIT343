    Mini Activity (5 mins) - until 2:00 pm
 
    1. Create an object named student with the following properties:

        name: "Alice"

        age: 20

        course: "Computer Science"

        grades: [85, 90, 78] 

    2. Print the initial student object.

    3. Add a new property hobbies with an array of at least two hobbies.

    4. Update the course property to "Software Engineering".

    5. Remove the age property.

    6. Add a new grade (95) to the grades array.

    7. Print the final student object.

    8. Take a screenshot of the console output and send it in the chat.
 
    Expected Output:
 
    Initial student object: 

    {name: 'Alice', age: 20, course: 'Computer Science', grades: Array(3)}
 
    Final student object: 

    {name: 'Alice', course: 'Software Engineering', grades: Array(4), hobbies: Array(2)}
